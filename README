Description
-----------

This is a very simple package that enables you to send mail through
gmail using python. It’s not a big deal, it does not read your emails,
no calendars, no drafts… It does just one thing, sending emails (possibly with attachments).

Requirements
------------

-  Python 3
-  pip3 for installation

Install
-------

Using ``setup.py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    git clone https://github.com/kindlychung/pygmail.git
    cd pygmail
    python3 setup.py install


Using pip:
~~~~~~~~~~

From github:

::

    pip3 install --upgrade git+https://github.com/kindlychung/pygmail.git

or from PyPI:

::

    pip3 install --upgrade pygmail2


Security
--------

It uses smtp, that’s all. You can always check the source code, of
course

Usage
-----

You need put your gmail account and password in ~/.pygmailrc, for example:

::

    xyz@gmail.com
    xyz_super_secret

From the shell:

::

    echo "hi there" | gmailsend xxx@yyy.com --subj hi --attach /path/to/file
    gmailsend xxx@yyy.com --subj hi --attach /path/to/file --body_file /path/to/bodyfile
    ## for help
    gmailsend -h

From python shell you can do things like:

::

    from pygmail2.Pygmail import mo
    from pygmail2.Addr import ad
    # send to one address
    mo.sm(to_addr = "xyz@example.com", subject= "test", text = "<b>hi there</b>")
    # send attachments
    mo.sm(to_addr = "xyz@example.com", subject= "test", text = "<b>hi there</b>", attachments = ["/tmp/x.txt", "/tmp/y.png"])
    # send to multiple addresses
    mo.sm(to_addr = ["xyz@example.com", "aaa@bbb.org"], subject= "test", text = "<b>hi there</b>", attachments = ["/tmp/x.txt", "/tmp/y.png"])
    # use html file as mail body
    mo.smf(to_addr = ["xyz@example.com", "aaa@bbb.org"], subject= "test", mailfile = "/tmp/x.html", attachments = ["/tmp/x.txt", "/tmp/y.png"])

You can store an address book in the csv format in the ~/.pygmail/email.csv file. For example:

::

    Xiao Lu,xl@eepcxx.org

Then you access this email address by:

::

    ad.xiao_lu_xl_eepcxx_org

The advantage of this is that you got autocompletion for free.

To save some typing, you can put the following lines in ~/.pygmail/startup.py:

::

    from pygmail2.Pygmail import mo
    from pygmail2.Addr import ad

And in your ~/.bash_aliases you can say:

::

    alias pym='PYTHONSTARTUP=~/.pygmail/startup.py ipython3'

Then every time you want to send an email, you can just start it up by pym.


Change log
