Description
===========

This is a very simple package that enables you to send mail through
gmail using python. It’s not a big deal, it does not read your emails,
no calendars, no drafts… It does just one thing, sending emails.

Security
========

It uses smtp, that’s all. You can always check the source code, of
course
